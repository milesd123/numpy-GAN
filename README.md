GAN Built in numpy for image upscaling. 
- Multiple layer classes with forward and backward methods
- Model classes(Generator & Discriminator) with training loops
- Not fit for training (Pytorch is better), but provides a good understanding of the layers & Math in a CNN
- Implemented VGG loss & gradient with PyTorch
